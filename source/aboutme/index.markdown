My name is Chandler Qian, a senior year undergraduate student in China. I major in Software Engineering and love programming as a hobby/interest.
I'd love to work as a software engineerer later in the US, but I'm also considering doing some work related to Cartoon/Animation, Music/Education, etc. Anyway, I love programming and everything related to computer/Internet, but I want to give it second thoughts whether I'll treat it as a lifelong job.
